Import the Scanner class for reading input\n2. Print \"Enter a number >> \" (using print instead of println to keep the cursor on the same line)\n3. Wait for the user to input a number and store it in the 'number' variable\n\nIf you want to accept decimal numbers instead of integers, you can use:\n```java\ndouble number = scanner.nextDouble();\n```\n\nOr if you want to accept any string input:\n```java\nString input = scanner.nextLine();\n```\nHow do you close the scanner?\n\nYou close the Scanner using the `.close()` method. Here's the complete code:\n\n```java\nimport java.util.Scanner;\n\npublic class NumberInput {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        Scanner scanner = new Scanner(System.in);\n        System.out.print(\"Enter a number >> \");\n        int number = scanner.nextInt();\n        \n        scanner.close();  // This is how you close the Scanner\n    }\n}\n```\n\nIt's good practice to close the Scanner when you're done using it to free up system resources. However, there are a few important things to note:\n\n1. Only close the Scanner if you're done with ALL input operations in your program\n2. Once you close a Scanner, you can't use it again\n3. If you're using Scanner with System.in, closing the Scanner will also close System.in\n4. If you need to read multiple inputs throughout your program, it's better to:\n   - Either keep one Scanner open for the duration of the program\n   - Or create and close separate Scanners as needed\n\nIf you're writing a small program or exercise, it's fine to leave the Scanner open, as Java will clean it up when the program ends.\n","messages":[{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":0},"start":0,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":113}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":20},"start":40,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":114}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":33},"start":61,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":115}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":58},"start":103,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":116}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":59},"start":999,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":117}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":103},"start":1030,"metadata":{"role":"assistant","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":118}}},{"id":{"replica_id":0,"value":104},"start":2141,"metadata":{"role":"user","status":"Done","timestamp":{"replica_id":0,"value":119}}}],"summary":"\"Java User Number Input\"","slash_command_output_sections":[{"range":{"start":0,"end":1},"icon":"Library","label":"Default","metadata":null}]}
